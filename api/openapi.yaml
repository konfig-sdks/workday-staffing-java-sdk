        Initiates an organization assignment change for a specific worker.
        Call this method to start a new change organization assignment event, which returns a new change organization assignment ID. Use the new ID to reference the change organization assignment event in subsequent methods that update or get information about the same event.

        The same Workday UI validations apply with this POST method.  The updates in this POST method do not persist until you call POST /organizationAssignmentChanges/{ID}/submit.

        In the request body, specify at least this required field: date, worker {id}, job {id}

        To retrieve a worker ID, call the GET /values/organizationAssignmentChangesGroup/workers prompt endpoint with the effectiveDate query parameter. It returns HREF links to workers by category. You can filter the results by effectiveDate. By default, it returns workers on the current date. Only workers without blocking events or available for organization assignment change for the current user are returned.

        To retrieve a job ID, call the /values/organizationAssignmentChangesGroup/jobs prompt endpoint with the worker query parameter.  It returns all positions for the worker with current user access to do an organization assignment change . You can filter the results by effectiveDate. By default, it returns positions on the current date.

        Partially updates the job profile options for the specified job change ID.

        The {subResourceID} path parameter must be the same as the {ID} value.

        You can call GET /jobChanges/{ID}/jobProfile/{subResourceID} to get the existing data to update.

        The same Workday UI validations apply with this PATCH method. The updates in this PATCH method do not persist until you call POST /jobChanges/{ID}/submit.

        In the request body, specify at least this required field: jobProfile{id}

        To retrieve a jobProfile ID, call the GET /values/jobChangesGroup/jobProfiles prompt endpoint, which takes the job change ID as the staffingEvent query parameter. If you specify the staffingEvent parameter, it returns HREF links to the job profiles by the prompt category. If you don't specify the staffingEvent parameter, it returns all job profiles, regardless of their categories. You can also filter the job profiles by the effectiveDate query parameter. The default is the current date.
